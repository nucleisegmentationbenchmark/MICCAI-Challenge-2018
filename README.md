# MICCAI-Challenge-2018
The primary objective of the proposed challenge in MICCAI 2018 is to develop a nuclei segmentation module that works right out the box to accurately segment nuclei in a diverse set of H&amp;E stained histology images. For this purpose, we will release a large dataset of images with annotated nuclear boundaries that are difficult to segment. This will enable training and testing of readily usable  (or generalized) nuclear segmentation pipelines. The dataset for this challenge is sampled from the whole slide images obtained from several hospitals and covers multiple organs, patients, and disease states.
